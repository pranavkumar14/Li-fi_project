# LIFI

## Intro  

Light Fidelity ie **Lifi**   is wireless communication based on Visible Light Communication. It is like Wifi but the major difference is that wifi uses radio waves while lifi uses visible light waves . In this data can be transferred using LED .
Professor Harald Hass coined the term "Lifi" at his TED Talk in 2011 when he introduced the idea of "wireless data from light" .

In this project till now we have seen data transmission through the wire and with this we will finally extend it to vlc transmission .

Presently high amount of research is going on Lifi to promote it's scope also some points for which lifi is better than other technologies are -
* Secure 
* Very less and cheap setup required .
* Higher speed .
* Has a large range of frequency available .
