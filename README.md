# Li-fi_project

This is a summer project on **Li-Fi** under Electronic's Club IITK . In this , firstly  we have made a basic study of how data transmission happen over wire based communication technology . We communicated over two microprocessor Arduino uno in Proteus Simulation with the help of two wires . Here second wire worked as a clock .   
  
Then we synchronized our clock and only one wire was used .
